# dotfiles

Personal Preferences and Settings for Alex Safatli

## Requirements

Before using these dotfiles there are a few things you'll need to install 
manually depending on what operating system you are running:

- Mac OS X needs git and Appleâ€™s command-line developer tools.
- You will probably need to download Fira Code to see that font in JetBrains.

## Installation

These dotfiles take into consideration what operation system you are running on 
automatically and tries to download dependencies. Apart from any exceptions 
above, all that's necessary is running

`make`

in this directory in a BASH terminal.

### Package Control

The Sublime Text packages will install themselves the next time you launch 
Sublime Text, but you need to install 
[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) first:

1. Press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>CMD</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> to bring up the command palette
2. Type `install`
3. Select the option to install Package Control
